# ML examples

A list of examples for Machine Learning: Keras for Deep Learning, Transfer Learning with PyTorch for Image Classification, EEG Classification, Decision Trees, Statistical Hypothesis Testing, A/B Testing.

The idea is to download an example quickly, be able to run it right away, go through the comments and links, modify it for your own needs and have a prototype in less than 30 minutes.
