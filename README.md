# ML Examples

This is a repository of Machine Learning/Data Science code samples. It includes the following domains:

  * Keras and PyTorch for Deep Learning
  * Transformers (with HuggingFace)
  * Transfer Learning with PyTorch for Image Classification
  * EEG ERP Classification
  * Decision Trees
  * Statistical Hypothesis Testing
  * A/B Testing
  * Autoencoders
  * Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

The idea is to download an example quickly, be able to run it right away, go through the comments and links, modify it for your own needs and have a [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) prototype in less than 15 minutes.
