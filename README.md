# ML Examples

A repository of Machine Learning/Data Science code samples: 
  * Keras for Deep Learning
  * Transfer Learning with PyTorch for Image Classification
  * EEG ERP Classification
  * Decision Trees
  * Statistical Hypothesis Testing
  * A/B Testing
  * Autoencoders
  * Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
  * Transformers (with HuggingFace)

The idea is to download an example quickly, be able to run it right away, go through the comments and links, modify it for your own needs and have a POC prototype in less than 15 minutes.
